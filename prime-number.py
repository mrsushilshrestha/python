#The prime number is division by 1 and its self is to be call prime numbers.

#Algorithm
#step:1 ->start
#step:2 -> input number
#step:3 -> divide number by 1 , 2 ,3 ......until less than and equal to input number
#step:4 ->count if number is divide or remainder ) 
#step :5 -> count is greater than 2 , then print "it is composite number"
#step :6 -> otherwise print prime numberS

number = input()
start =1
count =0

for(i=0;i<=n;i+1):
