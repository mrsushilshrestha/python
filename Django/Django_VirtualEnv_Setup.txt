Setting Up a Virtual Environment for Django

1. Install `virtualenv` (if needed)
   If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, run:
   pip install virtualenv

2. Create a Virtual Environment
   Navigate to your project folder and create the virtual environment:
   python -m venv virtualenvironment

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
   - Windows (CMD):
     virtualenvironment\Scripts\activate
   - Git Bash or MINGW64:
     source virtualenvironment/Scripts/activate
   - macOS/Linux:
     source virtualenvironment/bin/activate

   After activation, your terminal prompt should show the virtual environment name.

4. Install Django and Other Dependencies
   To install Django in the virtual environment:
   pip install django

5. Common Packages for Django Projects
   If your project requires additional packages, install them:
   - Database (PostgreSQL):
     pip install psycopg2
   - Django REST Framework (for APIs):
     pip install djangorestframework
   - Image Handling (Pillow):
     pip install pillow

6. Generate a `requirements.txt` File
   To keep track of installed packages:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

7. Install Packages from `requirements.txt`
   To install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

8. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
   When done, deactivate the virtual environment with:
   deactivate

Troubleshooting Reminder:
- Command not found: If you get an error like `bash: script: command not found`, make sure youâ€™re using the correct command syntax:
  - Activate (Git Bash): source virtualenvironment/Scripts/activate
- Missing packages: Always use pip install -r requirements.txt to reinstall all dependencies.
- Path issues: Double-check the folder and file paths; they are case-sensitive on some systems.
