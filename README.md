## Introduction 🌟
This repository is the result of my ongoing Python learning journey. It is meant to be a comprehensive resource for learning the core concepts of Python programming. Whether you're just starting out or are looking to deepen your knowledge, the code snippets and explanations here will help you along the way.

Python is a versatile language used in many fields, including web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. I'm excited to share this learning process with you, and I hope you'll find something valuable in this collection.

## Concepts Covered 🔍

### Variables & Data Types 🧮
Python is a dynamically typed language, so you don't need to declare variable types. Here are some basic data types in Python:

- **Integers** (`int`): Whole numbers (positive and negative).
- **Floating-point numbers** (`float`): Numbers with decimal points.
- **Strings** (`str`): Sequences of characters used for text.
- **Booleans** (`bool`): True or False values, often used in conditions.

You can also perform operations on variables like arithmetic or string operations:

# Variable Assignments
x = 10           # int
price = 19.99    # float
name = "Python"  # str
is_active = True # bool

# Operations on variables
total = x * 2
message = name + " is great!"  # String concatenation

**Type Conversion:**  
You can convert one data type to another, such as from a string to an integer.

```python
num_str = "100"
num_int = int(num_str)  # Convert string to integer
```

### Control Flow 🛠️
Control flow statements allow you to decide the order of execution based on conditions. The basic building blocks include:

- **If/elif/else Statements:** Choose different paths based on conditions.
- **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
- **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`.

Example:

```python
x = 20
if x >= 10:
    print("x is 10 or more.")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5.")
else:
    print("x is less than 10.")
```

---

### Functions 🔄
Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. You can define functions that accept input values, process them, and return results.

- **Functions with arguments**: Accept input values.
- **Functions without arguments**: Perform actions without input.
- **Return values**: Return results from functions.

Example:

```python
# Function with parameters and a return value
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Default Arguments:**  
You can define functions with default argument values.

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())  # Output: Hello, Guest!
```

---

### Loops 🔁
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code. Python has two primary types of loops:

- **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, range).
- **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a given condition is True.

Examples:

```python
# For loop (iterating through a range)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4

# While loop (repeat until condition is false)
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
    count += 1
```

You can also break out of loops or skip an iteration using `break` and `continue`.

### Data Structures 📊
Python has powerful built-in data structures for organizing and managing data:

- **Lists**: Ordered and mutable collection.
- **Tuples**: Ordered and immutable collection.
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: Unordered collection of unique items.

Examples:

```python
# List (mutable)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")  # Adding an item to the list

# Tuple (immutable)
coordinates = (10.5, 20.2)

# Dictionary (key-value pairs)
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

# Set (unique items only)
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3}  # Output will be {1, 2, 3}
```

---

### Modules & Libraries 📦
Python has a rich ecosystem of modules and libraries that extend its functionality.

- **Importing Modules**: You can bring in functionality from a module.
- **Creating Custom Modules**: Save your code in `.py` files and import them.

Example of using a built-in library:

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

---

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏗️
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that revolves around designing code using classes and objects. Python allows you to define classes with attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

#### Key Concepts in OOP:
- **Classes & Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class.
- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones.

Example:

```python
# Class definition
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine has started.")

# Creating an object (instance) of the Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has started.
```
